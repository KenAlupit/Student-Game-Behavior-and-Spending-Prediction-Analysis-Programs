# Student-Game-Behavior-and-Spending-Prediction-Analysis-Programs
This repository integrates two Python programs designed for analyzing game behavior data using machine learning techniques. Leveraging pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, it preprocesses categorical data through label and one-hot encoding. Interactive visualizations such as heatmaps and bar charts visualize correlations and frequency distributions of gaming platforms, genres, and budgets. The repository allows users to choose between K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Logistic Regression models for predicting gaming preferences based on selected features. It evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics and provides insightful visualizations like confusion matrices. This comprehensive toolset supports understanding and predicting gaming behaviors based on data-driven insights.
