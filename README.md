# Student-Game-Behavior-and-Spending-Prediction-Analysis-Programs
This repository integrates two Python programs designed for analyzing game behavior data using machine learning techniques. Leveraging pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, it preprocesses categorical data through label and one-hot encoding. Interactive visualizations such as heatmaps and bar charts visualize correlations and frequency distributions of gaming platforms, genres, and budgets. The repository allows users to choose between K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Logistic Regression models for predicting gaming preferences based on selected features. It evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics and provides insightful visualizations like confusion matrices. This comprehensive toolset supports understanding and predicting gaming behaviors based on data-driven insights.

**Each of the two programs answers these sets of questions:**

1. By knowing the games they play, the number of hours, and the gaming console, determine what is the course of the user. Consider the following: 

    - Accuracy of the models
    - Which model best suit for the problem? 

2. By getting the Course, the gaming console, and the expenditure, predict which GAME a user will most likely playing. 

    - Accuracy of the models
    - Which model best suit for the problem?
